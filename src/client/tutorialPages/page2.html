    <h1>Game Rules</h1>
    <p>Ultimate Noughts and Crosses is played on a large 9x9 grid, which consists of nine smaller 3x3 grids. Here are some more rules to follow:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Alternate Turns:</strong> Players take turns to make moves. Player 1 usually starts with noughts, and Player 2 with crosses.</li>
        <li><strong>Forced Grid:</strong> The cell you select in a smaller grid determines which smaller grid your opponent must play in next. They must make a move in the corresponding grid.</li>
        <li><strong>Winning the Game:</strong> To win the overall game, you need to win three smaller grids in a row, column, or diagonal, just like in regular Noughts and Crosses.</li>
    </ul>
