    <h1>Making Moves</h1>
    <p>Here's how you make moves in Ultimate Noughts and Crosses:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Click on an empty cell in any of the smaller grids. Your symbol will appear there.</li>
        <li>Your opponent will be directed to the corresponding smaller grid where they must make their move.</li>
        <li>The game continues in this manner until one player wins three smaller grids in a row, column, or diagonal.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Remember, you can only make a move in the grid determined by your opponent's last move.</p>
